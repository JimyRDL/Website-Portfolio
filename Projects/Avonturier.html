                    Avonturier is a story puzzle game made mainly for iPads in the first year of university. 
                    The target audience was kids from six to ten years old. The objective of the 
                    game was through research, testing and development get kids to be more attracted
                    to the real zoo Wildands,Emmen.

            <p>This game was the final project from the first year of university and it was the first time with a case given, in this case by the university. The case my team decided to go for was a case about "Wildands", the real zoo located in Emmen, Netherlands. 
                The main objective of this case was to make a game for families that made people attracted to the zoo. During the development of this game my role in this game was the lead programmer as I programmed the foundations 
                and most part of the game along with the build itself. However, although I focused mainly on programming and the build, I also contributed with modelling and texturing.

            </p>
            <h3 class="title-sections">My contribution</h3>
            <p>As I said before, I programmed most parts of the game and build most of it. Our game consisted on four locations (the same ones as the real zoo), the entrance and the three locations, each location had a minigame that had to be completed.
                <br>
                <br>
                The parts that I did not contributed directly in terms of programming and building were the first location (arctic) minigame, which consisted in destroying bubbles until the player destroyed 15; the transitions between screen; the main screen; the ending screen and the animation of the seal.
                <br>
                <br>
                I made the rest which consisted in movement with a joystick for iPad. Camera movement for iPad. Mechanics of the other two locations (serenga and jungle). Dialogue system. Progress manager that is not seen by the player. Quest tracker for each location. UI coding. Animations UI. And scene management.
                <br>
                <br>
                In terms of design I only made the first building in the entrance where the player goes through when they finish and the textures for the glass (for the same building), the textures for the floor in the entrance and the textures for the walls in the entrance.
